# OOPs--Banking-ENTRI

Banking System Project üè¶
Overview
This project replicates a simple Banking System using Python, designed to test and improve your coding and logical skills. The system allows users to log in, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their account balance. It is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for better structure and maintainability.
